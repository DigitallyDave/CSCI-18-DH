Post for Lab 5 - 3/11/2021


## **Intro to x86-64**

**Introduction**

The first step of this room was connecting to the machine through ssh. I connected to TryHackMe with the IP address and provided password. Next, I used the `ls` command to view the available directories and navigated to the introduction directory. From there, I used the command `./intro` to start the program. 

This output: value for a is 1 and b is 2
             value for a is 2 and b is 1
             
Using `r2 -d intro`, I opened radare2 in debugging mode so that it can analyse the program and determine what is going on. The command `aa` analyzes all entry points in the executable. Next, I ran `e asm.syntax=att` which set the syntax to AT&T. After this, I entered `afl` which in turn listed the functions to run. The rest of the intro contained more introductory commands 

**If Statements**

The next section was an overview of if statements as well as listing the different jump types. 

**If-Statements Continued**

With a little background on if-statements, I began the next section. I navigated to the "If-Statements" directory, entered the If2 file, and began radare2 with the command `r2 -d if2`. . I was then prompted to run the following commands, `aaa`, `afl`, `pdf @main`. The first command, analyzed the program and the `afl` command listed the functions. Finally, `pdf @main` disassembled the function at main. I then inserted break points at the first and last jump types using the `db` command and the hex address of the jump instructions. The `dc` command began the program which ran until it hit the breakpoints. I then ran the command `px @rbp-0x8` which showed the value of 8. Running the command `ds` moves onto the the next instruction. Using these steps, I was able to answer the questions and move to the next segment. 

**Loops**
