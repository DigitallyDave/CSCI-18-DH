##### **_Try Hack Me Rooms_**

**Welcome Room**

As this was my very first time with TryHackMe, working through entry rooms was very helpful. While trying to start my machine, I became lost and for some reason thought I needed Kali Linux to connect. Because I did not have Kali yet, I spent a long time figuring out how to get it. After I had Kali working through VirtualBox, I returned to the TryHackMe room and realized I was able to complete the room through my browser. Looking back, I got caught up in figuring out how to work OpenVPN, when all I had to do was follow the instructions closely. I was able to deploy my machine and entered the IP address into the built-in Mozilla browser. I was rewarded with the flag stating I was connected. Thus, I finished the Welcome room.
