##### **_Try Hack Me Rooms_**

**Welcome Room**

As this was my very first time with TryHackMe, working through entry rooms was very helpful. While trying to start my machine, I became lost and for some reason thought I needed Kali Linux to connect. Because I did not have Kali yet, I spent a long time figuring out how to get it. After I had Kali working through VirtualBox, I returned to the TryHackMe room and realized I was able to complete the room through my browser.
