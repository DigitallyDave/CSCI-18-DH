Post for Lab 10 - 5/7/2021


## **Physical Security** 

This week's post involves the Physical Security TryHackMe room. The first task consisted of two videos of two different speakers on the topic of physical security. After watching the videos, I began the room, most of which consisted of questions that I was able to answer from the videos. 

For the first set of questions, I learned of the differences of overt entry, covert entry, and surreptitious entry. Overt entry describes entry that is clearly visible to any person, trained or untrained. For example, if a thief entered a building through a broken window, this would be overt entry. Covert entry would be entry that is detectable only to trained the trained eye such as lock picking. Lastly, surreptitious entry would occur if an individual had a key copied which he/she used to enter through a door. This form of entry is undetectable by even the trained professionals. 

The second task contained questions concerning basics of lock picking. Examples included types of picks, locks, and tenchniques.
