Post for Lab 11 - 5/26/2021


## **TryHackMe Capstone** 

I started my process by a simple nmap scan to find open ports so I could see what I was dealing with. `nmap -sV machine_IP` The scan ran successfully and I found three open ports. Ports 21, 22, and 80. I was first interested in port 21 because on it, ProFTPD 1.3.3c was running. I used the command, `searchsploit proftpd` and learned that there was was a backdoor vulnerability for that specific ProFTPD version.
