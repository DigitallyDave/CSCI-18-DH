## **TryHackMe Blue Room**

**Recon**

The first step for the room was recon. Using the Nmap command `nmap -sV -vv --script vuln` with the IP of my machine. This command started a scan that scanned for all open ports and informed me of the vulnerability that I could exploit. After the scan completed, I asnwered a question concerning the number of open ports as well as which vulnerability the machine was succeptible to. 

**Gain Access**

In order to gain access, I began by running Metasploit using the command `msfconsole`. Metasploit was now up and running and I was then tasked to find the exploitation code that I could run against the machine. I used the `search ms17` command which brough up a list of all exploits with the keywords "ms17". I found the code I needed move on the the next step. Using the Metasploit command `use 8`, I easily switched to the exploit and ran it.

**Escalate**
